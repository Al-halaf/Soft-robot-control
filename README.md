# Soft-robot-control
This project focuses on training a soft robotic gripper to pick up a tennis ball using reinforcement learning (RL) and MuJoCo. By leveraging Stable-Baselines3, this environment allows an RL agent to learn grasping behaviors through trial and error.

🚀 Features
MuJoCo-based Robotic Simulation: A custom-built MuJoCo environment for training a robotic arm with a soft gripper.
Reinforcement Learning with PPO: Uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from Stable-Baselines3 to train the agent.
Reward Optimization: Encourages reaching, grasping, and lifting the ball while penalizing unnecessary movement.
Training Checkpointing: Allows saving and continuing training from previous sessions.
Interactive Rendering: Visualizes the agent’s performance in real time.
📦 Requirements
To run the project, install the following dependencies:

Python
Libraries:
stable-baselines3

🔄 Workflow
1️⃣ Environment Setup: Loads the MuJoCo model and initializes the RL environment.
2️⃣ Training the RL Agent: Uses PPO to train the soft gripper to grasp the ball.
3️⃣ Reward Shaping:

Positive rewards for moving toward the ball.
Bonus for grasping and lifting the ball.
Penalty for moving away from the ball.
4️⃣ Training Continuation: Allows loading saved models to continue training.
5️⃣ Testing: Runs a trained policy in the simulation to evaluate performance.
🎯 Applications
This project can be applied in:

Robotic grasping research for industrial and household robots.
Reinforcement learning experiments in continuous control tasks.
Soft robotics simulations for real-world deployment.
